# Zlang
A programming language built in C that uses Gen-Z slang as syntax.

## Running Zlang Code
Zlang uses the `.sigma` file extension, so all Zlang code should be written in a `.sigma` file. To run the code, download the latest version of `zlang.exe` from either the source code or the releases. To run the file, open a terminal in the directory that contains `zlang.exe` and run the following command:
```
zlang.exe <filename.sigma>
```
Note: You may have to change the command to `.\zlang.exe` because PowerShell might not recognize the command.
