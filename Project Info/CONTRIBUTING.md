# Contributing to Zlang
Thanks for wanting to be a part of the **Zlang** community! Here are some quick tips on contributing to the **Zlang** language.

## How to Contribute
1. Make a fork of the repo
2. Create a branch with a **descriptive title**. The title should clearly convey what you are working on, not just be some jibberish.
3. Make changes or fix bugs
4. **Test your changes**. Please don't skip this step.
5. Make a pull request. The request will be reviewed, and if your code works and fits the project, I'll accept it. When you make the request, make sure you explain what exactly you changed, I don't want to go scrolling through the blame.

## Tips
- Only work on one thing at a time. Don't start off trying to add a massive new feature to the language.
- Keep the style of the code similar to the rest of the project.
- If you don't know how to start, ask someone! Or if you're really not sure, create an issue with your suggestion or bug report.
